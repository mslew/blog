## Background

The film details the systematic killing of Osage Native Americans in Oklahoma during the 1920s. You may be wondering, why? The Osage came into an extraordinary amount of wealth due to their land falling on vast amounts of oil. As *Killers of the Flower Moon* describes, they were some of the richest people on planet Earth per capita. 

## The Good

Robert De Niro as William Hale is awesome. Leonardo DiCaprio as Ernest Burkhart is amazing. Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart is magnetic. The plot and story are also great. Some people were upset about the runtime being 3 hours and 26 minutes, but I didn't have a problem with it; the pacing and editing of the film make the extra hour run by smoothly.

Probably most importantly, the film brings to light some truly heinous atrocities that many people may have not heard of before. I read the book *Killers of The Flower Moon* by David Grann, which the movie is based on, and I was truly shocked by the events that took place. 

## The Differences 

The book is written to be a mystery. The movie is written to not be a mystery. This key distinction was shocking to me because I read the book and was expecting the former. Nevertheless, the movie is still great and a must-watch for any moviegoer.

## Verdict 

An important movie. One of Scorsese's best and a great collaboration between De Niro, DiCaprio, and Gladstone.
