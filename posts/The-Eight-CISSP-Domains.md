# CISSP

CISSP stands for Certified Information Systems Security Professional. It is a globally recognized certification for experienced cybersecurity professionals. There are eight domains that are covered for this exam.

## Security and Risk Management

## Asset Security

Secures digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data. Security analysts may be tasked with properly destroying old equipment, especially regarding confidential information. 

## Security Architecture and Engineering

## Communications and Network Security

## Identity and Access Management

A security analyst may need to validate the identities of employees and document access roles, or employee keycard access.

Security analysts conduct regular audits of user permissions to make sure that users have the correct level of access, such as payroll information access is often limited to certain employees. 

## Security Operations

Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures. A security analyst would need to follow the procedures outlined by the organization if an unknown device is connected to the network.

## Software Development Security

A security analyst would work with software development teams to ensure practices are incorporated into the software development lifecycle, such as advising on. password policies and any user data are properly managed.
