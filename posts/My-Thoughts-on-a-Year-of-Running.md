# Introduction

On November 24, 2024, I decided to make a drastic change in my life and started running. From then on it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I have lost 60 pounds, am in the best shape of my life, and am enjoying the process of running, which I thought I would never say before.

# What am I doing? 

I started by doing the [Couch to 5K Program](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/6-week-training-plan-5k-beginner-final-1591631365.jpg). This program basically starts you by alternating between running and walking. It first starts with a minute of walking and a minute of running. Sooner or later, you start running more and walking less, and by the end, you try to complete a 5K (3.11 miles) without stopping to walk. This initial period of running was so weird for me, a lot of imposter syndrome, asking myself, “Can I do this?” “What am I thinking? I'm not a runner.” I felt so slow and lethargic that I had serious thoughts of quitting. Also, the second day of the program, it started to snow (Of course!). The biggest thing for me was that I continued to do it and didn't give up. I needed to understand that I am going to be slow for months, and understand that
